This repository consists of a query text file which was written on hive to pully the data using hadoop.
The hadoop was accessed using AWS where an EMR cluster was created.
An amazon S3 bucket was made which consists of the csv file.

A TF-IDF python file is used to give the total frequency of occurance of words in a csv file.
